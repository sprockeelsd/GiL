- Handle errors when no solution or no more solution
- Clean everything and make it clearer
- Add method for bab
- Add arguments for domain bounds
- Add a main to create and solve the problem in c++
- Generalize the solver creating function to take an argument specifying the type of solver
- Generalize the get-next-solution function to take any Search object
- Add a get-next-sol or something function to the lisp part so there are only 3 functions : create the problem, create the solver, get the next solution directly as numbers
- Handle null solutions in lisp so it doesn't throw an error
