# GiLv2.0

GiL (Gecode interface Lisp) is a wrapper that allows to use Gecode functions in Lisp programs. It is far from complete but does provides enough tools to generate interesting CSPs in Common Lisp. It is the continuation of Baptiste Lapi√®re's work (https://github.com/blapiere/GiL). 
Features supported include Integer, Boolean and Set variables and arrays along with a variety of constraints for those types of variables, various branching strategies, depth-first-search and branch-and-bound search engines, several search options,...

GiL is an open-source project, therefore any contributions are welcome. Please email me at @damien.sprockeels@uclouvain.be if you wish to contribute.

## How to use
**Disclaimer : GiL currently only works on MacOS And Ubuntu.**

*For MacOS Users*
Install Gecode, a Common Lisp implementation and CFFI. Depending on what MacOS version you are using, you might run into a problem with the dynamic library not finding Gecode due to a relative path problem. If this is the case, there is a script **script.sh** in the c++ folder that should solve the problem. You should update the value for the relative and full path in the script, then run it. The problem should be gone after that.

*For Linux Users*
Install Gecode, a Common Lisp implementation and CFFI. Add the path to your gecode installation folder (it looks like gecode-release-x.x.x) to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (help [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13428910/how-to-set-the-environmental-variable-ld-library-path-in-linux)). That's it.

You are ready to load the library and use it! A small example problem is shown in the **Gil** pdf. The exact same problem is given in C++ and in Lisp.

## Recompiling Gil
To recompile Gil in case of problem or after some modification you can use the makefile in Gil/C++, for MacOS use "make dylib" and for linux "make so".

## How to improve GiL
The **Gil** pdf provides explanation on how to add features to GiL. Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of ideas to add : 

- Adding the Limited Discrepancy and other search engine
- Adding support for other variable types
- Adding other constraints

Basically the long term goal is to support all Gecode features in GiL.

## Known issues
- the g-value function currently only works for displaying integer variables
- the Args variables are not supported which hurts the efficiency of the search for complex problems
